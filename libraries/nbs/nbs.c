*  Name:
*     NBS

*  Purpose:
*     High-level routines for the noticeboard system
*     --- this module contains only those routines that are user-callable.

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     The noticeboard system routines provide a fast means for processes to
*     share data in global memory. A given process may own as many noticeboards
*     as it wishes and may access noticeboards owned by other processes.
*     Normally the only process that writes to a noticeboard is its owner but
*     other processes that know what they are doing can subvert this rule
*     either by calling a special routine or else by accessing noticeboard data
*     by using a pointer.
*
*     The original interfaces were defined at the {AAO} workshop in October
*     1985. {V1.0} was implemented in C by William Lupton at {RGO} in January
*     1986. The changes for {V2.3.1} were made by William Lupton at {AAO} in
*     February 1990. Refer to Section~\ref {V2.3.1 New Features} for details.
*     Changes for {V2.4.0} were made by David Allan at the University of
*     Birmingham.
*
*     Noticeboards are identified by name and each can contain a hierarchy of
*     items. Each item has a name, a type, a structure / primitive attribute,
*     and, if primitive, a maximum number of dimensions, a maximum number of
*     bytes, a current shape and a current value. The type and shape are not
*     used by the routines but their values can be put and got and they can be
*     used when implementing higher-level routines on top of the noticeboard
*     routines. Noticeboards are self-defining --- a process can find and access
*     data from a noticeboard without knowing anything about what it contains.
*
*     \section {General Description}
*     \subsection {Names and Types} All names and types are converted to
*     upper-case and all white space and non-printing characters in them are
*     ignored. Thus " {\tt William Lupton} " is regarded as "WILLIAMLUPTON". An
*     upper limit of 16 characters is imposed on both names and types (the
*     limit applies to the length after the removal of white space and
*     non-printing characters).
*
*     \subsection {Data Consistency} Provided there is only one writer to a
*     noticeboard and the standard get and put routines are used, the routines
*     will guarantee that consistent data is read from the noticeboard. A
*     writer will never have to wait but a reader will retry potentially until
*     a timeout occurs.
*
*     \subsection {Static Definition} A (deliberate) restriction of the
*     noticeboard system is that a noticeboard is static in structure. Its
*     structure must be defined before any values are put into it and once the
*     definition is complete no more items can be created. There are a set of
*     routines called NBS_DEFINE_* and NBS_*_DEFINITION which allow definition
*     of noticeboard contents, saving definitions to and restoring them from
*     file (the initial state of a noticeboard is that all items have zero
*     length values). Only once the definition phase is complete can the
*     NBS_PUT_* and NBS_GET_* routines be used.
*
*     The initial reason for this was efficiency. However it is not in fact
*     particularly difficult to allow new items to created on the fly without
*     compromising efficiency and this restriction should be seen more as a way
*     of preventing the noticeboard routines from being used for purposes for
*     which they were not designed and for which better tools (such as HDS)
*     exist. Note that this "static" restriction refers only to the creation of
*     items in the noticeboard. It is always possible to change item shapes and
*     values.
*
*     \subsection {Saving to Disc} When saving a noticeboard to disc, the
*     programmer has a choice as to whether to save only the definition
*     or else the definition plus the data. If only the definition is saved
*     then each time that the definition is restored
*     all items will revert to having zero lengths. However if the data
*     is saved as well the NBS_RESTORE_NOTICEBOARD routine can be used
*     to restore both the definition and the data, and a subsequent call
*     to NBS_SAVE_NOTICEBOARD will update the disc file so that the next
*     time that the noticeboard is restored it will be in the same state
*     as when it was saved.
*
*     \subsection {C-callable Version} The NBS routines have been implemented
*     to make them easy to use from Fortran and for this reason all character
*     strings are passed by address of VMS descriptor and all other parameters
*     are passed by reference. The routines are actually written in C and it
*     would be unreasonable and wasteful to force C programmers to build
*     descriptors just so that they could be decoded back to the same C strings
*     that they started off as. For this reason, every NBS routine has an
*     associated NBC routine which passes all character parameters as C
*     zero-terminated strings, all input scalar parameters by value and all
*     other parameters by reference. See the source of the demonstration
*     programs described in Appendix~\ref {Demonstration Programs} for examples
*     of the use of this C-callable version.
*
*     \subsection {Portability to UNIX} The NBS routines have been implemented
*     in as portable a way as possible. In particular they have successfully
*     been ported to a UNIX System V system (well, {V2.2} was anyway), which
*     just happens to have a set of shared memory system services that are
*     sufficiently close in facilities to the VMS global section system
*     services to require only a small amount of conditionally compiled code in
*     the low-level "create section" and "map section" routines. Portability is
*     perhaps not a major issue at present but it is good to know that the use
*     of the noticeboard system routines will not necessarily be a bar to
*     portability in the future.
*
*     \subsection {Status Conventions} All the NBS routines use ADAM modified
*     status conventions in that they will do nothing if status is not NBS__OK
*     (0) on entry. They can all optionally be called as functions, in which
*     case the function value is the same as the returned status value.
*
*     \subsection {Terminology} These routines use the terminology "item" to
*     refer to either a structured noticeboard object (ie, one with no values
*     but possibly having lower-level objects) or to a primitive noticeboard
*     object (ie, one with a shape and with values). The terms
*     "item identifier", "identifier" or "ID" refer to "handles" (cf HDS
*     locators) which allow access to all information pertaining to an item. As
*     far as callers are concerned these are just integers. As far as the
*     noticeboard system is concerned they are pointers to data structures
*     called "item_descriptor"s. In the routine specifications they are
*     regarded as integers. A zero ID is always an invalid ID and all routines
*     will detect an attempt to use a zero ID. Similarly all routines that
*     return ID's will return zero ID's on failure. Note that there is a danger
*     of an access violation if true garbage ID's are passed. This is unlikely
*     to happen, because of the use of the modified status convention.

*  History:
*     03-Feb-1986 (WFL):
*        Original version
*     05-Jul-1986 (JAB):
*        Speed up search loop in NBS_FIND_ITEM: NBS_STRIMP call
*        removed from loop, NBS_RELOCATE_ADDRESS calls removed and
*        relocation coded directly.
*     13-Apr-1987 (WFL):
*        Correct bug whereby MAXNAME-char names are not found
*         in NBS_FIND_ITEM since they are not null-terminated.
*         Prevent NBS_END_DEFINITION from copying more than
*         MAXNAME characters from NAME.
*     17-Jul-1987 (WFL):
*        Change names of INCLUDEd files to be NBS_xxx.H.
*         Check for zero IDs on entry and replace NULL with NIL.
*         Remove ENVID from NBS_GET_NAME.
*         New NBS_GET_PARENT, NBS_GET_MODIFIED and NBS_INC_MODIFIED routines.
*     20-Jul-1987 (WFL):
*        In NBS_GET_SHAPE, regard MAXDIMS as modified argument
*         and return as maximum number of dimensions.
*         Alter interface to NBS_STR* routines.
*         Use ODD function for testing incoming LOGICALs.
*         Replace NBS_COPY with _CHMOVE macro.
*         New status NBS__TOOMANYBYTES in NBS_PUT_VALUE, plus
*         use NBS__TOOMANYDIMS in NBS_PUT_SHAPE.
*     21-Jul-1987 (WFL):
*        Add new NBS_PUT_SIZE routine.
*         Add definition size, section size and version to the
*         board info that is part of the global section - check version
*         in NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD
*         In NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD, make a relocated copy of the
*         entire noticeboard definition and thus dispense with the
*         relocating in NBS_FIND_ITEM and NBS_FIND_NTH_ITEM.
*         Correct apparent bug in NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD where
*         mapper's PID was copied to overwrite creator's PID.
*         Bring inline the three NBS_*_FIELDS routines and modify
*         so that items are added in alphabetical order.
*         Ensure that all routines that return ID's return NIL
*         ones if they fail.
*         Add logical argument to relocate routines telling
*         them whether to add or subtract the offset. Split IFS_OFFSET
*         argument into I_OFFSET for items and FBS_OFFSET for fixed,
*         board and shape information.
*     22-Jul-1987 (WFL):
*        Remove board_info BASE; set up BOARD pointers at
*            definition time and don't take local copies of board_info.
*     31-Jul-1987 (WFL):
*        Extend header comments.
*         Insert missing braces after IF_OK... macro calls.
*     06-Nov-1987 (WFL):
*        Portable VMS / UNIX version. Use vms / unix / strdescr
*         macros as necessary.
*     11-Feb-1988 (WFL):
*        Use macros for routine names and use NBS_ prefix when
*         strdescr is defined, NBC_ when it is not. Also use #module to
*         set module name explicitly. Change strdescr to c_string.
*         Change NBS_ADD_INTERLOCKED to ADD_INTERLOCKED.
*         Change SAVE to character OPTION in NBS_END_DEFINITION.
*         Add OFFSET arguments to NBS_PUT_VALUE and NBS_GET_VALUE.
*     16-Feb-1988 (WFL):
*        Add TIMEOUT_COUNT, WORLD_WRITE, INCREMENT_MODIFY and
*         CHECK_MODIFY static variables and NBS_TUNE routine to alter them
*         Add handling of FIXED_INFO CHILDREN component.
*         Add handling of BOARD_INFO MODIFIED component and return
*         it with NBS_GET_MODIFIED for non-primitive items.
*         Add NBS_GET_CHILDREN to return number of children and
*         NBS_GET_INFO to return miscellaneous information about a
*         noticeboard.
*         Make NBS_FIND_ITEM use a binary search (since the
*         names are known to be linked in alphabetical order).
*     17-Feb-1988 (WFL):
*        Receive definitions of MAXALLOC, ITEM_BASE and DATA_BASE
*         from NBS_MAC.H and allow tune of MAXALLOC (now called
*         MAX_DEFN_SIZE).
*     03-Mar-1988 (WFL):
*        Improve binary search.
*         Update comments ready for use in documentation.
*     25-Mar-1988 (WFL):
*        Simple-minded implementation of saving data to
*         disc, restoring from disc etc. Involves new NBS_RESTORE_NOTICE-
*         BOARD and NBS_SAVE_NOTICEBOARD routines.
*         Alter NBS_GET_INFO to take name of required item (so
*         that the interface need not continually change).
*     28-Mar-1988 (WFL):
*        Rationalise initialisation of BOARD_INFO components.
*     30-Mar-1988 (WFL):
*        Only use #module on VMS; allow NBS_TUNE to use same
*         arguments for new and old values; make NBS_END_DEFINITION
*         clear DEFINING even if it fails (once re-location is done);
*         re-order NBS_INC_MODIFIED and NBS_PUT_SIZE.
*     08-Apr-1988 (WFL):
*        (Again) update comments ready for use in documentation.
*     20-May-1988 (WFL):
*        Use NBS_INTIMP to import input integers (allows them
*         to be passed by value for the C interfaces).
*     10-Apr-1989 (WFL):
*        Use EXTERN rather than STATIC so that NBS and NBC
*         routines can be used intermingled (but not values alterable
*         using NBS_TUNE, since these are initialised)
*     01-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Add TIMEOUT_INTERVAL to list of tuneable parameters;
*         add NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD and set extra board info parameters
*         on noticeboard creation; use noticeboard-specific parameters
*         on get and put; maintain ACCESSED count; allow use of same
*         variable for ENV(S)ID and (S)ID; on find noticeboard, wait
*         for it to be valid; delay between tries on get
*     02-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Add NBS_LOSE_NOTICEBOARD and NBS_LOSE_ITEM; if notice-
*         board existed when being created, adopt current process as
*         owner; on NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD and if owner, unmap section
*         mapped on create
*     06-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Account for PARENT, DATA and ACCESSED being in unions;
*         maintain TRIGGER and MODIFIED in ITEM_DESCR; use
*         _ADD_INTERLOCKED macro (uses _ADAWI); add new NBS_PUT_TRIGGER,
*         NBS_GET_MODIFIED_POINTER and NBS_GET_UPDATED routines; be
*         careful to unmap if mapping routine fails after having mapped;
*         add use of ORIGINAL_UNMAPPED
*     07-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Account for SHAPE and GLOBAL_BASE being in unions;
*         update modified count for NBS_PUT_SIZE; explicitly set NIL
*         top-level PARENT in relocated copy of definition
*     09-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Upgrade comments; GET_MODIFIED_POINTER to work for
*         structures too; always increment noticeboard modified count;
*         use ADD_INTERLOCKED for noticeboard modified count increment;
*         use OR of NBS_TUNE flags and NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD flags for
*         upwards compatibility; correct test for NBS__DATASAVED
*     15-Feb-1990 (WFL):
*        Revert to regarding TIMEOUT_COUNT and TIMEOUT_DELAY
*         as per-process values
*     25-Mar-1993 (DJA):
*        Error reporting by EMS. All high level routines report errors
*        as well as setting STATUS bad.
*        #module moved to nbs_module.h to cope with failure of ULTRIX
*        to handle this preprocessor directive.
*        Use F77 and CNF package to do FORTRAN interface.
*        New routines NBS_GET_CVALUE, NBS_PUT_CVALUE and NBS_GET_CINFO
*        to handle put and fetch of character values portably.
*        Prologue formats changed to SST forms.
*      5-May-1993 (DJA):
*        New routine NBS_SLEEPMS provides millisecond timing. Replaced
*        _wait macro in NBS_MAC.H. Exit handler to remove remaining mapped
*        sections on UNIX.
*     24-Nov-1994 (DJA):
*        Correct Fortran version of NBS_GET_CVALUE call.
*     27-Apr-1999 (BKM):
*        Omit unnecessary malloc and free declarations.
*     28-Jun-2004 (AA):
*        Fixed ifdef logic for building under Mac OSX
*     12-Sep-2004 (TIMJ):
*        Minimize compiler warnings. Use new style ems calling convention.
*     04-Jul-2005 (PWD):
*        Comment out void arglist function prototypes. GCC4 doesn't allow those.
*     15-SEP-2008 (TIMJ):
*        3-arg emsSetc is deprecated.

*  Section name:

*     Routines used to alter global noticeboard system parameters

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     Two types of parameters can be altered. The first type is global to a
*     process and not to a noticeboard (they are essentially Fortran COMMON
*     block or C static variables). The second type is global to a noticeboard
*     and are thus shared by all processes accessing that noticeboard. The
*     original NBS_TUNE routine is used to alter parameters of the first type
*     and the newer NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD is used to tune parameters of the
*     second type. When a noticeboard is created, its initial parameter values
*     are copied from the current values of the first type.
*
*     When a parameter is altered, its previous value is returned and this
*     permits a routine to alter a parameter, use the new value and then
*     restore the parameter to its previous value.
*
*     The NBS_FIND, NBS_GET and NBS_PUT routines make rather complicated use of
*     these values. For those parameters which are logical flags, they use
*     the OR of the value of the first type and the value of the second type.
*     For those parameters which are numeric values, they use the value of the
*     first type.

*  Name:
*     NBS_TUNE

*  Purpose:
*     Alter the value of a global parameter

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_TUNE (NAME,VALUE,OLDVALUE,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Check that the parameter name is legal. \\
*     Copy the previous value of the parameter to the supplied variable. \\
*     Alter the specified global parameter.
*
*     There are currently six global parameters which can be altered in
*     this way:
*
*     [MAX_DEFN_SIZE:] an integer that indicates how much memory should
*        be allocated for building the noticeboard definition during the
*        definition phase. The default is 32768 bytes.
*     [TIMEOUT_COUNT:] an integer that indicates how many times to loop
*        before timing out when finding noticeboards or when getting values
*        or shapes. The default is 100.
*     [TIMEOUT_INTERVAL:] an integer that indicates how many milliseconds
*        to wait between attempts at finding noticeboards or when getting
*        values or shapes. The default is 100.
*     [WORLD_WRITE:] a logical (only the lsb is used) that indicates whether
*        the world (ie non-owners) can write to noticeboards. The default is
*        FALSE.
*     [INCREMENT_MODIFY:] a logical (only the lsb is used) that indicates
*        whether the modified count should be incremented when putting the
*        values of items. The default is TRUE.
*     [CHECK_MODIFY:] a logical (only the lsb is used) that indicates whether
*        the modified count should be checked when getting the values of items.
*        The default is TRUE.
*
*     Note that the parameters which can be altered are global to a process and
*     not to a noticeboard (they are essentially Fortran COMMON block or C
*     static variables). When a parameter is altered its previous value is
*     returned and this permits a routine to alter a parameter, use the new
*     value and then restore the parameter to its previous value.
*
*     The NBS_FIND, NBS_GET and NBS_PUT routines make rather complicated use of
*     these values. For those parameters which are logical flags, they use
*     the OR of the default value (or the value set using NBS_TUNE) and the
*     value set using NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD. For those parameters which are
*     numeric values, they use the value set using NBS_TUNE.
*
*     When a noticeboard is created, it inherits the default values or the
*     values set using NBS_TUNE and these values may subsequently be altered
*     using the NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD routine.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The name of the parameter to alter. See the above list. Can be
*        abbreviated so long as it remains unambiguous but this is not
*        recommended because new parameters may be supported in the future.
*        Case is not significant.
*     VALUE = INTEGER (Given)
*        The value that the parameter is to take.
*     OLDVALUE = INTEGER (Returned)
*        The old value of the parameter.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status.
*                NBS__BADOPTION	=> Illegal parameter name

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_DEFINE_STRUCTURE (ENVSID,NAME,TYPE,SID,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Check that we are currently in the middle of defining a noticeboard. \\
*     Check that the environment static ID is not NIL and does not pertain to
*     a primitive item. \\
*     Allocate space to describe the new item and fill in fields appropriate to
*     a structured item such that items at this level are in alphabetical order.
*     (If an item of this name already exists, create a new item but position it
*     before the existing item). \\
*     Return the address of the item descriptor to the caller for use in
*     subsequent calls.

*  Arguments:
*     ENVSID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Static identifier of the item in the noticeboard which is the
*        parent of the item to be created.
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Name of the new item.
*     TYPE = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Type of the new item.
*     SID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Static identifier of the new structured item. This should be used in
*        subsequent calls to the NBS_DEFINE_* routines.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status. Possible return values are,
*        	NBS__NOTDEFINING => Not currently defining a noticeboard
*        	NBS__NILSID	    => NIL static ID
*        	NBS__PRIMITIVE  => Prospective parent is primitive
*        	NBS__NOMOREROOM => Storage area is full up

*     Check that we are currently in the middle of defining a noticeboard. \\
*     Calculate how large the definition and data parts of the noticeboard
*     are. \\
*     Relocate all pointers in the definition so that they are relative to zero
*     rather than being actual program virtual addresses (actually they are
*     made relative to a small positive integer to avoid problems with zero
*     pointers). \\
*     If the option parameter indicates, write the definition and optionally
*     the data to a file (a default file extension of .NBD is applied). \\
*     Otherwise, create the noticeboard, copy the definition to it, write the
*     calling process' id to the global section to denote ownership and mark
*     the noticeboard as being valid. \\
*     De-allocate the memory area used to amass the noticeboard definition and
*     note that we are no longer defining a noticeboard. \\
*
*     If the noticeboard already existed, NBS__SECTIONEXISTED status is
*     returned and the calling process becomes its owner.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        If OPTION is DEFINITION_SAVE or NOTICEBOARD_SAVE, the name of the
*        file to write the definition or definition plus data to (with a
*        default file type of .NBD). Otherwise (OPTION is CREATE_NOTICEBOARD)
*        the name of the noticeboard to create.
*     OPTION = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        Option that governs whether the noticeboard definition or definition
*        plus data is saved to a file or whether the noticeboard is simply
*        created on the spot without being associated with a file. Can be
*        abbreviated so long as it remains unambiguous but this is not
*        recommended because new options may be supported in the future. Case
*        is not significant. Possible values are:
*
*            DEFINITION_SAVE => Save the definition to a file that
*        		does not contain space allocated for the data.
*           NOTICEBOARD_SAVE => Save the definition to a file that
*        		does contains space allocated for the data.
*            CREATE_NOTICEBOARD => Create the noticeboard immediately
*        		without associating it with a file. This is assumed
*        		if an illegal value of OPTION is given.
*
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status. Possible return values are,
*        	NBS__NOTDEFINING => Not currently defining a noticeboard
*        	NBS__CANTOPEN   => Can't create the definition file
*        	NBS__CANTWRITE  => Can't write the definition file
*        	NBS__SECTIONEXISTED => Noticeboard of this name already
*        			    existed
*
*             	SS$_*	    => System service codes from SYS$CRMPSC

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_SAVE_NOTICEBOARD (ID,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Items can be found either by name or by position. When a noticeboard
*     is found a private copy of its item descriptors is made in which all
*     non NIL pointers are relocated by the virtual address of the start of

*     information pertaining to it can in fact be accessed using standard C

*  Name:
*     NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD

*  Purpose:
*     Find a named noticeboard and return an identifier to it

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_FIND_NOTICEBOARD (NAME,ID,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Map the noticeboard of the given name. \\
*     Allocate an item descriptor and relocate it so that the version number
*     can be checked and the definition size determined. \\
*     Free that item descriptor and allocate a block of memory big enough for
*     the entire definition. \\
*     Copy the definition part to this memory and relocate it so that all
*     pointers are once again virtual memory addresses. \\
*     Get the process' id for future checking against the owner's process id. \\
*     If this is the owner process and it hasn't already been done, unmap the
*     copy mapped earlier.
*
*     Note that it is somewhat wasteful to build a complete copy of the
*     noticeboard definition in private memory when in fact only the pointers
*     must have private versions. A later version of the software should take
*     copies only of the pointers but this requires the pointer space to be
*     allocated separately during the definition phase --- in the current
*     implementation the pointer space is not contiguous; pointers are mixed up
*     with fixed information, shape information and board information.

*  Arguments:
*     NAME = CHARACTER*(*) (Given)
*        The name of the noticeboard which is to be found.
*     ID = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Identifier of the top-level of the noticeboard.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status. Possible return values are,
*        	NBS__SECTIONNOTFOUND => No section called NAME existed
*        	NBS__TIMEOUT    => Timeout awaiting valid noticeboard
*        	NBS__NOMOREROOM => Failed to allocate private memory area
*        	NBS__BADVERSION => Wrong version in noticeboard

*  Description:
*     The noticeboard system maintains counts of how many items have been
*     found using NBS_FIND_ITEM and NBS_FIND_NTH_ITEM. The routines in this
*     section can be used to indicate that noticeboards and items are no

*     for deletion. When an item is no longer required, its parent's item
*     count is decremented. Normally, noticeboards and items can only be lost
*     if the count of items found from them is zero (this is to minimise the
*     chance of using an item ID to access a non-existent noticeboard), but
*     this can be overridden.

/*
*  Section Name:
*     NBS_PUT

*  Purpose:
*     Routines that write information to a noticeboard

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     This can normally only be done by the owner of the noticeboard. The only
*     things which can be written are shape information and data. The item's
*     modified count is incremented both before and after each write using the
*     ADD_INTERLOCKED instruction. The noticeboard's modified count is
*     incremented after each write. These modified counts allow other processes
*     to monitor the noticeboard for changes.
*
*     When writing data to an item, it is possible to specify the offset
*     at which the data is to start. The actual size of the item's data
*     is the high-water mark of all the data that has been written to the
*     item. For example, if 10 bytes are written at offset 0, the size is
*     10 bytes, but if then 100 bytes are written at offset 4000, the size
*     is 4100 bytes, even though bytes 11 to 4000 have not been written.
*     It is guaranteed that all such unwritten bytes are zero. It is
*     occasionally necessary to adjust the actual size of an item's data
*     and there is a routine explicitly to do this. For example, the size
*     of the above item could be adjusted back to 10 bytes. Note that if
*     1 byte were now written at an offset of 10000, the item size would
*     now be 10001 bytes and the 100 bytes at offset 4000 would retain the
*     values that they were given earlier (they would not be reset to zero).
*
*     There are two global parameters which can be altered using the
*     NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD routine and which affect the behaviour of these
*     routines:
*
*     1. WORLD_WRITE is FALSE by default and this prevents processes other
*        than the noticeboard's owner from writing to it. If set TRUE, this
*        process will be allowed to write to the noticeboard even if it does
*        not own it. If set TRUE then it is possible for a reader to read data
*        that is currently varying, so only do this if you know what you are
*        doing. All processes can always access all noticeboard's directly if
*        they do so via pointer --- such access is not affected by the
*        WORLD_WRITE flag.
*
*     2. INCREMENT_MODIFY is TRUE by default and this causes the item's
*        modified count to be incremented before and after the update and the
*        noticeboard's modified count to be incremented after the update. If
*        set FALSE, neither count is altered. Clearly, if this is done, other
*        processes monitoring the modified counts will not realise that
*        noticeboard data is changing.
*
*     There is also a lower-level routine that must only be used by people who
*     really know what they are doing. It increments either the noticeboard
*     modified count or a primitive item's modified count. This {\em must} be
*     called according to the same conventions as are applied in NBS_PUT_VALUE.
*     If this is not done, the whole system is subverted.
*
*     Finally, there is a routine which specifies a user-supplied routine to be
*     called whenever an item's shape, data, size or modified count is altered.
*     This routine is called in the context of the process which alters the
*     noticeboard --- there are no facilities for notifying directly any other
*     processes (although the user-supplied routine may of course do this
*     itself).

/*

*  Name:
*     NBS_PUT_VALUE

*  Purpose:
*     Put a byte array into a slice of a primitive item
*     associated with a specified identifier

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_PUT_VALUE (ID,OFFSET,NBYTES,BYTE_ARRAY,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Check that the ID is not NIL and that it pertains to a primitive item. \\
*     Check that the caller owns the noticeboard (or WORLD_WRITE is TRUE). \\
*     Check that the offset into the data is not negative. \\
*     Check that the item is large enough to accept all of the supplied
*     values. \\
*     Increment the item's modified count. \\
*     Update the item size (maintain a high-water mark). \\
*     Copy the values to the noticeboard. \\
*     Increment the item's modified count again. \\
*     Increment the noticeboard modified count.
*
*     The item and noticeboard modified counts will not be incremented if
*     INCREMENT_MODIFY is FALSE.
*
*     Note that this routine only alters the specified number of bytes starting
*     at the specified offset --- all bytes are initially zero and bytes above
*     and below those that are being altered will not be affected. The actual
*     size of the item will be adjusted upwards if the new data extends past the
*     previous end of the data but the size of the item cannot be decreased by
*     this routine. To alter the size of an item, use the NBS_PUT_SIZE routine.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of the item which the value is to be put.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        Byte offset into item data.
*     NBYTES = INTEGER (Given)
*        Number of bytes to put.
*     BYTES = BYTE(*) (Given)
*        Bytes to be put.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status. Possible return values are,
*        	NBS__NILID	  => NIL ID
*        	NBS__NOTPRIMITIVE => Item is not primitive
*        	NBS__NOTOWNER 	  => Caller does not own the noticeboard
*        	NBS__BADOFFSET	  => Negative offset specified
*        	NBS__TOOMANYBYTES => Not room to put all the data

*  Notes:
*     In versions prior to {V2.4.0} this routine could be used to write
*     character strings on the VAX using the %REF() mechanism to pass
*     the character data. A new routine, NBS_PUT_CVALUE, has been provided
*     to remove the need for %REF and make the method portable.

*  Name:
*     NBS_GET

*  Purpose:
*     Routines that read information from a noticeboard

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Description:
*     Normally this is a very straightforward operation, but when reading
*     shape information and data it is necessary to check that the owner of
*     the information has not altered it whilst it is being read.
*
*     There are three global parameters which can be altered using the
*     NBS_TUNE_NOTICEBOARD routine and which affect the behaviour of the
*     shape and data reading routines:
*
*     1. CHECK_MODIFY is TRUE by default and this means that the item's
*        modified count is checked both before and after reading the data. The
*        data is read repeatedly until the value of this count is even and
*        unchanging or until a timeout occurs. If set FALSE, no such checks are
*        made and no timeout can occur.
*
*     2. TIMEOUT_COUNT is 100 by default and is the maximum number of times
*        that the data reading will be tried.
*
*     3. TIMEOUT_INTERVAL is 100 by default and is the delay in milliseconds
*        between tries.

*     Check that the offset into the data is not negative. \\
*     Repeat \= \{ \\

*               in the item. \\

*                     were being read).
*     \end {tabbing}
*
*     If CHECK_MODIFY is FALSE, the item's modified count is not checked
*     at all and a timeout cannot occur.
*
*     If the specified offset is greater than the current size of the item's
*     data, no error status will be returned and no data will be copied, but
*     the returned number of bytes (ACTBYTES) will be less than the offset
*     (OFFSET) and this case should always be checked for.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of the item from which thew value is to be got.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        Byte offset into item data.

*        Size in bytes of the user's buffer.
*     BYTE_ARRAY = BYTE(*) (Returned)
*        User's buffer into which bytes will be got.
*     ACTBYTES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Actual number of values associated with the item. This may be
*        greater than OFFSET + MAXBYTES but no more than MAXBYTES bytes
*        will be copied into the user's buffer.
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and returned)
*        The global status. Possible return values are,
*        	NBS__NILID	  => NIL ID
*         	NBS__NOTPRIMITIVE => Item is not primitive

*  Purpose:

*  Language:
*     ANSI C

*  Invocation:
*     (Int) = NBS_GET_CVALUE (ID,OFFSET,STRING,ACTBYTES,STATUS)

*  Description:
*     Extracts the string data pointer and string length from the
*     FORTRAN argument list, and passes this information to NBS_GET_VALUE.
*     Thus, the number of bytes read is at most the length the string
*     supplied.

*  Arguments:
*     ID = INTEGER (Given)
*        Identifier of the item from which thew value is to be got.
*     OFFSET = INTEGER (Given)
*        Byte offset into item data.
*     STRING = CHARACTER*(*) (Returned)
*        Users string buffer into which item bytes will be got.
*     ACTBYTES = INTEGER (Returned)
*        Actual number of values associated with the item. This may be

*        	NBS__BADOFFSET	  => Negative offset specified
*        	NBS__TIMEOUT	  => Timeout awaiting valid data

*  Notes:
*     No C version of this routine is supplied because C strings are
*     by convention null terminated. As NBS_GET_CVALUE writes new
*     string data, its correct functioning in the C case would rely on
*     the unwarranted assumption that sufficient space existed in the
*     destination string for the data to be written. By forcing the use
*     of NBS_GET_VALUE in this case, the user must at least state the
*     destination length explicitly.

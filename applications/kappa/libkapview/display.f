      SUBROUTINE DISPLAY( STATUS )
*+
*  Name:
*     DISPLAY

*  Purpose:
*     Displays a one- or two-dimensional NDF.

*  Language:
*     Starlink Fortran 77

*  Type of Module:
*     ADAM A-task

*  Invocation:
*     CALL DISPLAY( STATUS )

*  Arguments:
*     STATUS = INTEGER (Given and Returned)
*        The global status.

*  Description:
*     This application displays a one- or two-dimensional NDF as an
*     image on the current image-display device.  The minimum and
*     maximum data values to be displayed can be selected in several
*     ways (see Parameter MODE).  Data values outside these limits are
*     displayed with the colour of the nearest limit.  A key showing the
*     relationship between colour and data value can be displayed (see
*     Parameter KEY).
*
*     Annotated axes or a simple border can be drawn around the image
*     (see Parameters AXES and BORDER).  The appearance of these may be
*     controlled in detail (see Parameters STYLE and BORSTYLE).
*
*     A specified colour lookup table may optionally be loaded prior to
*     displaying the image (see Parameter LUT). For devices which reset
*     the colour table when opened (such as postscript files), this may
*     be the only way of controlling the colour table.
*
*     The image is produced within the current graphics database
*     picture.  The co-ordinates at the centre of the image, and the
*     scale of the image can be controlled using Parameters CENTRE,
*     XMAGN and YMAGN.  Only the parts of the image that lie within the
*     current picture are visible; the rest is clipped.  The image is
*     padded with bad pixels if necessary.

*  Usage:
*     display in [comp] clear [device] mode [centre] [xmagn] [ymagn]
*        [out] { low=? high=?
*              { percentiles=?
*              { sigmas=?
*              mode

*  ADAM Parameters:
*     AXES = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if labelled and annotated axes are to be drawn around the
*        image.  These display co-ordinates in the current co-ordinate
*        Frame of the supplied NDF, and may be changed using application
*        WCSFRAME (see also Parameter USEAXIS).  The width of the
*        margins left for the annotation may be controlled using
*        Parameter MARGIN.  The appearance of the axes (colours, founts,
*        etc.) can be controlled using the STYLE parameter.
*        [current value]
*     BADCOL = LITERAL (Read)
*        The colour with which to mark any bad (i.e. missing) pixels in
*        the display.  There are a number of options described below.
*
*        - "MAX" -- The maximum colour index used for the display of the
*        image.
*
*        - "MIN" -- The minimum colour index used for the display of the
*        image.
*
*        - An integer -- The actual colour index.  It is constrained
*        between 0 and the maximum colour index available on the device.
*
*        - A named colour -- Uses the named colour from the palette, and
*        if it is not present, the nearest colour from the palette is
*        selected.
*
*        -  An HTML colour code such as \#ff002d.
*
*        If the colour is to remain unaltered as the lookup table is
*        manipulated choose an integer between 0 and 15, or a named
*        colour.  The suggested default is the current value.
*        [current value]
*     BORDER = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if a border is to be drawn around the regions of the
*        displayed image containing valid co-ordinates in the current
*        co-ordinate Frame of the NDF.  For instance, if the NDF
*        contains an Aitoff all-sky map, then an elliptical border will
*        be drawn if the current co-ordinate Frame is galactic longitude
*        and latitude.  This is because pixels outside this ellipse have
*        undefined positions in galactic co-ordinates.  If, instead, the
*        current co-ordinate Frame had been pixel co-ordinates, then a
*        simple box would have been drawn containing the whole image.
*        This is because every pixel has a defined position in pixel
*        co-ordinates.  The appearance of the border (colour, width,
*        etc.) can be controlled using Parameter BORSTYLE.
*        [current value]
*     BORSTYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use for the border (see Parameter BORDER).
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).  [current value]
*     CENTRE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The co-ordinates of the data pixel to be placed at the centre
*        of the image, in the current co-ordinate Frame of the NDF
*        (supplying a colon ":" will display details of the current
*        co-ordinate Frame).  The position should be supplied as a list
*        of formatted axis values separated by spaces or commas.  See
*        also Parameter USEAXIS.  A null (!) value causes the centre of
*        the image to be used.  [!]
*     CLEAR = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if the current picture is to be cleared before the image
*        is displayed. [current value]
*     COMP = LITERAL (Read)
*        The NDF array component to be displayed.  It may be "Data",
*        "Quality", "Variance", or "Error" (where "Error" is an
*        alternative to "Variance" and causes the square root of the
*        variance values to be displayed).  If "Quality" is specified,
*        then the quality values are treated as numerical values (in
*        the range 0 to 255).  ["Data"]
*     DEVICE = DEVICE (Read)
*        The name of the graphics device used to display the image.
*        The device must have at least 24 colour indices or greyscale
*        intensities.  [current graphics device]
*     FILL = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If FILL is set to TRUE, then the image will be "stretched" to
*        fill the current picture in both directions.  This can be
*        useful when displaying images with markedly different
*        dimensions, such as two-dimensional spectra.  The dynamic
*        default is TRUE if the array being displayed is
*        one-dimensional, and FALSE otherwise.  []
*     HIGH = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The data value corresponding to the highest pen in the colour
*        table.  All larger data values are set to the highest colour
*        index when HIGH is greater than LOW, otherwise all data values
*        greater than HIGH are set to the lowest colour index.  The
*        dynamic default is the maximum data value.  There is an
*        efficiency gain when both LOW and HIGH are given on the
*        command line, because the extreme values need not be computed.
*        (Scale mode)
*     IN = NDF (Read)
*        The input NDF structure containing the data to be displayed.
*     KEY = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        TRUE if a key to the colour table is to be produced to the
*        right of the display.  This can take the form of a colour ramp,
*        a coloured histogram of pen indices, or graphs of RGB
*        intensities, all annotated with data value.  The form and
*        appearance of this key can be controlled using Parameter
*        KEYSTYLE, and its horizontal position can be controlled using
*        Parameter KEYPOS.  If the key is required in a different
*        location, set KEY=NO and use application LUTVIEW after
*        displaying the image.  [TRUE]
*     KEYPOS( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The first element gives the gap between the right-hand edge of
*        the display and the left-hand edge of the key, as a fraction
*        of the width of the current picture.  If a key is produced,
*        then the right-hand margin specified by Parameter MARGIN is
*        ignored, and the value supplied for KEYPOS is used instead.
*
*        The second element gives the vertical position of the key as a
*        fractional value in the range zero to one: zero puts the key as
*        low as possible, one puts it as high as possible.  A negative
*        value (no lower than -1) causes the key to match the height of
*        the display image.  This may mean any text, like a label, for
*        the horizontal axis may not appear, though if AXES is TRUE there
*        is usually room.  [current value]
*     KEYSTYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use for the key (see Parameter KEY).
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).
*
*        Axis 1 is always the "data value" axis.  So for instance, to
*        set the label for the data-value axis, assign a value to
*        "Label(1)" in the supplied style.
*
*        To get a ramp key (the default), specify "form=ramp".  To
*        get a histogram key (a coloured histogram of pen indices),
*        specify "form=histogram".  To get a graph key (three curves of
*        RGB intensities), specify "form=graph".  If a histogram key
*        is produced, the population axis can be either logarithmic or
*        linear.  To get a logarithmic population axis, specify
*        "logpop=1".  To get a linear population axis, specify
*        "logpop=0" (the default).  To annotate the long axis with pen
*        numbers instead of pixel value, specify "pennums=1" (the
*        default, "pennums=0", shows pixel values).  [current value]
*     LOW = _DOUBLE (Read)
*        The data value corresponding to the lowest pen in the colour
*        table.  All smaller data values are set to the lowest colour
*        index when LOW is less than HIGH, otherwise all data values
*        smaller than LOW are set to the highest colour index.   The
*        dynamic default is the minimum data value.  There is an
*        efficiency gain when both LOW and HIGH are given on the
*        command line, because the extreme values need not be computed.
*        (Scale mode)
*     LUT = NDF (Read)
*        Name of the NDF containing a colour lookup table in its Data
*        array; the lookup table is written to the image-display's
*        colour table.  The purpose of this parameter is to provide a
*        means of controlling the appearance of the image on certain
*        devices, such as colour printers, that do not have a dynamic
*        colour table (i.e. the colour table is reset when the device is
*        opened).  If used with dynamic devices (such as X-windows),
*        the new colour table remains after this application has
*        completed. A null value (! ) causes the existing colour table
*        to be used.
*
*        The LUT must be two-dimensional, the dimension of the first
*        axis being 3, and the second being arbitrary.  The method used
*        to compress or expand the colour table if the second dimension
*        is different from the number of unreserved colour indices is
*        controlled by Parameter NN.  Also the LUT's values must lie in
*        the range 0.0--1.0. [!]
*     MARGIN( 4 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The widths of the margins to leave around the image for axis
*        annotations, given as fractions of the corresponding dimension
*        of the current picture.  The actual margins used may be
*        increased to preserve the aspect ratio of the data.  Four
*        values may be given, in the order bottom, right, top, left.
*        If fewer than four values are given, extra values are used
*        equal to the first supplied value.  If these margins are too
*        narrow any axis annotation may be clipped.  If a null (!) value
*        is supplied, the value used is (for all edges); 0.15 if
*        annotated axes are being produced; 0.04, if a simple border is
*        being produced; and 0.0 if neither border nor axes are being
*        produced. [current value]
*     MODE = LITERAL (Read)
*        The method by which the maximum and minimum data values to be
*        displayed are chosen.  The options are as follows.
*
*        - "Current" -- The image is scaled between the upper and lower
*        limits that were used by the previous invocation of DISPLAY. If
*        the previous scaling limits cannot be determined, the MODE
*        value reverts to "Scale".
*
*        - "Faint" -- The image is scaled between the mean data value
*        minus one standard deviation and the mean data value plus seven
*        standard deviations.  The scaling values are reported so that
*        the faster Scale mode may be utilised later.
*
*        - "Flash" -- The image is flashed onto the screen without any
*        scaling at all.  This is the fastest option.
*
*        - "Percentiles" -- The image is scaled between the data values
*        corresponding to two percentiles.  The scaling values are
*        reported so that the faster Scale mode may be used later.
*
*        - "Range" -- The image is scaled between the minimum and
*        maximum data values.
*
*        - "Scale" -- You define the upper and lower limits between
*        which the image is to be scaled.  The application reports the
*        maximum and the minimum data values for reference and makes
*        these the suggested defaults.
*
*        - "Sigmas" -- The image is scaled between two
*        standard-deviation limits.  The scaling values used are
*        reported so that the faster Scale mode may be utilised later.
*     NN = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the input lookup table is mapped to the colour table by
*        using the nearest-neighbour method.  This preserves sharp
*        edges and is better for lookup tables with blocks of colour.
*        If NN is FALSE linear interpolation is used, and this is
*        suitable for smoothly varying colour tables.  NN is ignored
*        unless LUT is not null.  [FALSE]
*     NUMBIN  =  _INTEGER (Read)
*        The number of histogram bins used to compute percentiles for
*        scaling. (Percentiles mode)  [2048]
*     OUT = NDF (Write)
*        A scaled copy of the displayed section of the image. Values in
*        this output image are integer colour indices shifted to exclude
*        the indices reserved for the palette (i.e. the value zero
*        refers to the first colour index following the palette).  The
*        output NDF is intended to be used as the input data in
*        conjunction with SCALE=FALSE.  If a null value (!) is supplied,
*        no output NDF will be created.  This parameter is not accessed
*        when SCALE=FALSE.  [!]
*     PENRANGE( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The range of colour indices ("pens") to use. The supplied values
*        are fractional values where zero corresponds to the lowest available
*        colour index and 1.0 corresponds to the highest available colour
*        index. The default value of [0.0,1.0] thus causes the full range
*        of colour indices to be used. Note, if Parameter LUT is null
*        (!) or Parameter SCALE is FALSE then this parameter is ignored
*        and the fill range of pens is used. [0.0,1.0]
*     PERCENTILES( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The percentiles that define the scaling limits. For example,
*        [25,75] would scale between the quartile values. (Percentile
*        mode)
*     SCAHIGH = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        On exit, this holds the data value which corresponds to the
*        maximum colour index in the displayed image.  In Flash mode or
*        when there is  no scaling the highest colour index is returned.
*     SCALE = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE the input data are to be scaled according to the value
*        of Parameter MODE.  If it is FALSE, MODE is ignored, and the
*        input data are displayed as is (i.e. the data values are simply
*        converted to integer type and used as indices into the colour
*        table).  A value of zero refers to the first pen following the
*        palette.  A FALSE value is intended to be used with data
*        previously scaled by this or similar applications which have
*        already performed the required scaling (see Parameter OUT).  It
*        provides the quickest method of image display within this
*        application. [TRUE]
*     SCALOW = _DOUBLE (Write)
*        The data value scaled to the minimum colour index for display.
*        In Flash mode or when there is no scaling the lowest colour
*        index is used.  The current display linear-scaling minimum is
*        set to this value.
*     SIGMAS( 2 ) = _REAL (Read)
*        The standard-deviation bounds that define the scaling limits.
*        To obtain values either side of the mean both a negative and
*        a positive value are required.  Thus [-2,3] would scale
*        between the mean minus two and the mean plus three standard
*        deviations.  [3,-2] would give the negative of that.
*     SQRPIX = _LOGICAL (Read)
*        If TRUE then the default value for YMAGN equals the value
*        supplied for XMAGN, resulting in all pixels being displayed as
*        squares on the display surface. If a FALSE value is supplied for
*        SQRPIX, then the default value for YMAGN is chosen to retain the
*        pixels original aspect ratio at the centre of the image. [current value]
*     STYLE = GROUP (Read)
*        A group of attribute settings describing the plotting style to
*        use for the annotated axes (see Parameter AXES).
*
*        A comma-separated list of strings should be given in which each
*        string is either an attribute setting, or the name of a text
*        file preceded by an up-arrow character "^".  Such text files
*        should contain further comma-separated lists which will be read
*        and interpreted in the same manner.  Attribute settings are
*        applied in the order in which they occur within the list, with
*        later settings overriding any earlier settings given for the
*        same attribute.
*
*        Each individual attribute setting should be of the form:
*
*           <name>=<value>
*
*        where <name> is the name of a plotting attribute, and <value>
*        is the value to assign to the attribute.  Default values will
*        be used for any unspecified attributes.  All attributes will be
*        defaulted if a null value (!)---the initial default---is
*        supplied.  To apply changes of style to only the current
*        invocation, begin these attributes with a plus sign.  A mixture
*        of persistent and temporary style changes is achieved by
*        listing all the persistent attributes followed by a plus sign
*        then the list of temporary attributes.
*
*        See section "Plotting Attributes" in SUN/95 for a description
*        of the available attributes.  Any unrecognised attributes are
*        ignored (no error is reported).  [current value]
*     USEAXIS = GROUP (Read)
*        USEAXIS is only accessed if the current co-ordinate Frame of
*        the NDF has more than two axes.  A group of two strings should
*        be supplied specifying the two axes which are to be used when
*        annotating the image, and when supplying a value for Parameter
*        CENTRE.  Each axis can be specified using one of the following
*        options.
*
*        - Its integer index within the current Frame of the input
*        NDF (in the range 1 to the number of axes in the current
*        Frame).
*        - Its symbol string such as "RA" or "VRAD".
*        - A generic option where "SPEC" requests the spectral axis,
*        "TIME" selects the time axis, "SKYLON" and "SKYLAT" picks the
*        sky longitude and latitude axes respectively.  Only those axis
*        domains present are available as options.
*
*        A list of acceptable values is displayed if an illegal value is
*        supplied.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the axes with the
*        same indices as the two used pixel axes within the NDF are used.
*        [!]
*     XMAGN = _REAL (Read)
*        The horizontal magnification for the image.  The default
*        value of 1.0 corresponds to 'normal' magnification in which the
*        the image fills the available space in at least one dimension.
*        A value larger than 1.0 makes each data pixel wider.  If this
*        results in the image being wider than the available space then
*        the image will be clipped to display fewer pixels.  See
*        also Parameters YMAGN, CENTRE, SQRPIX, and FILL.  [1.0]
*     YMAGN = _REAL (Read)
*        The vertical magnification for the image.  A value of 1.0
*        corresponds to 'normal' magnification in which the image fills
*        the available space in at least one dimension.  A value larger
*        than 1.0 makes each data pixel taller.  If this results in the
*        image being taller than the available space then the image will
*        be clipped to display fewer pixels.  See also Parameters XMAGN,
*        CENTRE, and FILL.  If a null (!) value is supplied, the default
*        value used depends on Parameter SQRPIX.  If SQRPIX is TRUE,
*        the default YMAGN value used is the value supplied for XMAGN.
*        This will result in each pixel occupying a square area on the
*        screen.  If SQRPIX is FALSE, then the default value for YMAGN
*        is chosen so that each pixel occupies a rectangular area on
*        the screen matching the pixel aspect ratio at the centre of the
*        image, determined within the current WCS Frame.  [!]

*  Examples:
*     display ngc6872 mode=p percentiles=[10,90] noaxes
*        Displays the NDF called ngc6872 on the current graphics
*        device.  The scaling is between the 10 and 90 per cent
*        percentiles of the image. No annotated axes are produced.
*     display vv256 mode=flash noaxes border
*             borstyle="colour=blue,style=2"
*        Displays the NDF called vv256 on the current graphics
*        device.  There is no scaling of the data; instead the modulus
*        of each pixel with respect to the number of colour-table
*        indices is shown.  No annotated axes are drawn, but a blue
*        border is drawn around the image using PGPLOT line style
*        number 2 (i.e. dashed lines).
*     display mode=fa axes style="^sty,grid=1" margin=0.2 clear
*             out=video \
*        Displays the current NDF DATA component with annotated axes
*        after clearing the current picture on the current graphics
*        device. The appearance of the axes is specified in the text
*        file sty, but this is modified by setting the Grid attribute
*        to 1 so that a co-ordinate grid is drawn across the plot. The
*        margins around the image containing the axes are made slightly
*        wider than normal. The scaling is between the -1 and +7
*        standard deviations of the image around its mean.  The scaled
*        data are stored in an NDF called video.
*     display kn26 axes key keypos=[0.0,-1.0] keystyle=^key.sty \
*        Displays the NDF called kn26 using the current scaling,
*        surrounded by axes.  It adds a colour-table key to the right
*        that abuts the data picture and is aligned vertically with
*        the image.  The plot attributes set in the text file key.sty
*        controls the appearance of the key.
*     display video noscale \
*        Displays the DATA component of the NDF called video (created
*        in the previous example) without scaling within the current
*        picture on the current graphics device.
*     display in=cgs4a comp=v mode=sc low=1 high=5.2 device=xwindows
*        Displays the VARIANCE component of NDF cgs4a on the xwindows
*        device, scaling between 1 and 5.2.
*     display mydata centre="12:23:34 -22:12:23" xmagn=2 badcol="red" \
*        Displays the NDF called mydata centred on the position
*        RA=12:23:34, DEC=-22:12:23. This assumes that the current
*        co-ordinate Frame in the NDF is an equatorial (RA/DEC) Frame.
*        The image is displayed with a magnification of 2 so that each
*        data pixel appears twice as large (on each axis) as normal.
*        Fewer data pixels may be displayed to ensure the image fits
*        within the available space in the current picture.  The current
*        scaling is used, and bad pixels are shown in red.
*     display ngc6872 mode=ra device=lj250 lut=pizza
*        Displays the NDF called ngc6872 on the LJ250 device. The
*        lookup table in the NDF called pizza is mapped on the LJ250's
*        colour table.  The scaling is between the minimum and maximum
*        of the image.

*  Notes:
*     -  For large images the resolution of the graphics device may
*     allow only a fraction of the detail in the data to be plotted.
*     Therefore, large images will be compressed by block averaging when
*     this can be done without loss of resolution in the displayed
*     image.  This saves time scaling the data and transmitting them to
*     the image display.  Note that the default values for Parameters
*     LOW and HIGH are the minimum and maximum values in the compressed
*     floating-point data.
*     -  If no Title is specified via the STYLE parameter, then the
*     TITLE component in the NDF is used as the default title for the
*     annotated axes.  If the NDF does not have a TITLE component, then
*     the default title is taken from current co-ordinate Frame in the
*     NDF.  If this has not been set explicitly, then the name of the
*     NDF is used as the default title.
*     -  The application stores a number of pictures in the graphics
*     database in the following order: a FRAME picture containing the
*     annotated axes, the image area, and the border; if there is a key,
*     a KEY picture encompassing the key and its annotations; and a DATA
*     picture containing just the image area.  Note, the FRAME picture
*     is only created if annotated axes or a border have been drawn, or
*     if non-zero margins were specified using Parameter MARGIN.  The
*     world co-ordinates in the DATA picture will be pixel co-ordinates.
*     A reference to the supplied NDF, together with a copy of the WCS
*     information in the NDF are stored in the DATA picture.  On exit
*     the current database picture for the chosen device reverts to the
*     input picture.
*     -  The data type of the output NDF depends on the number of colour
*     indices: _UBYTE for no more than 256, _UWORD for 257 to 65535,
*     and _INTEGER otherwise.   The output NDF will not contain any
*     extensions, UNITS, QUALITY, and VARIANCE; but LABEL, TITLE, WCS
*     and AXIS information are propagated from the input NDF.  The
*     output NDF does not become the new current data array.  It is a
*     Simple NDF (because the bad-pixel flag is set to false in order to
*     access the maximum colour index, and to handle sections),
*     therefore only NDF-compliant applications can process it.

*  Related Applications:
*     KAPPA: WCSFRAME, PICDEF, LUTVIEW; Figaro: IGREY, IMAGE;
*     SPECDRE: MOVIE.

*  Implementation Status:
*     -  This routine correctly processes the AXIS, DATA, QUALITY,
*     VARIANCE, LABEL, TITLE, WCS and UNITS components of the input NDF.
*     -  Processing of bad pixels and automatic quality masking are
*     supported.
*     -  This application will handle data in all numeric types, though
*     type conversion to integer will occur for unsigned byte and word
*     images.  However, when there is no scaling only integer data will
*     not be type converted, but this is not expensive for the expected
*     byte-type data.

*        Use CNF_PVAL
*     27-JAN-2006 (DSB):
*        Ignore blank titles supplied in STYLE.
*     6-FEB-2006 (DSB):
*        Use KPG1_ASTTL to get the title.
*     2006 April 12 (MJC):
*        Remove unused variables.
*     20-APR-2006 (DSB):
*        If annotated axes are not being drawn, remove the requirement
*        for the WCS->PIXEL transformation to be defined. Shorten
*        variable comments so that each fits entirely on one line.
*     18-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Handled base->current Mappings that have both transformations
*        defined but which do not form a true inverse pair (as created
*        by CHANMAP).
*     26-MAY-2006 (DSB):
*        Handled WCS FrameSets that define specific regions ("Regions Of
*        Interest") around which annotated grids should be drawn.

*     15-SEP-2009 (DSB):
*        Use NINT instead of KPG1_FLOOR/CEIL when calculating WILBND and
*        WIUBND. This avoids slight numerical inaccuracies introduced by
*        complex WCS Mappings producing shifts of whole pixels.
*     2010 October 14 (MJC):
*        Permit temporary style attributes.
*     15-MAR-2012 (DSB):
*        When getting WCS from the NDF, always ensure the current Frame
*        is 2-dimensional.
*     10-FEB-2015 (DSB):
*        Since 20-OCT-2009, setting the Ident attribute for a FrameSet
*        changes the Ident for the FrameSet itself, not for the current
*        Frame. So now we need to extract a pointer to the current Frame
*        before setting the Ident attribute.
*     6-DEC-2016 (DSB):
*        Modify Parameter KEYPOS to allow it to set the vertical key
*        position as well as the horizontal position.

*        Add Parameter PENRANGE.
*     2020 July 30 (MJC)
*        Allow placement of the key to match the image via negative
*        Paramter KEYPOS's second value.  Fix bug in call to KPG1_LUTKY.
*        Added note on the AGI KEY picture, and an example using this
*        new feature.

\chapter{\xlabel{pol2_advanced}POL-2 -- Advanced Data Reduction}
\label{sec:advanced}

The \poltwomap\ tool for reducing POL-2 data was originally released for
general science community use several years ago. The fact that its
development remains ongoing directly reflects the continuing advances
made at the cutting edge of POL-2 data reduction and analysis.

This advanced section of the POL-2 data reduction documentation aims
to provide you with additional tools and options with which to refine
your individual POL-2 data-reduction processes.

For further ideas, see \cref{Section}{sec:tailoredDR}{Tailoring a reduction}.

\section{\xlabel{addingdata}Adding new observations}

If you receive additional data after an initial POL-2 reduction of a partial dataset,
then it is almost always easier (and the process more robust) for you to simply
re-run the reduction process ''from scratch'' for the whole, augmented dataset.
Despite the associated additional processor time cost, therefore, you are generally
recommended to adopt this approach, rather than to attempt to combine new
observations with pre-existing \poltwomap\ reduction products.

For completeness, however, this section describes the six-step process of
combining data for one or more new POL-2 observations into existing $I$, $Q$,
and $U$ maps and vector catalogue created by an earlier run of \task{pol2map}.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Create a text file listing all the existing auto-masked $I$ maps
  for individual observations stored in the directory specified by
  Parameter \param{MAPDIR}, and then add in the raw data files for the new
  observations. The auto-masked $I$ maps have names that end in
  \file{$\_$imap.sdf}.

\begin{terminalv}
% ls maps/*imap.sdf > infiles.list
% ls rawdata/*.sdf  >> infiles.list
\end{terminalv}


\item Create a new auto-masked, co-added $I$ map including the new
  observation. The \calcqu\ and \makemap\ commands   will be run on the new
  data and the resulting maps combined with the existing maps derived
  from the older observations to create the new map:

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map in=^infiles iout=iauto_new qout=! uout=! mapdir=maps \
     qudir=qudata
\end{terminalv}


\item A decision needs to be taken as to whether to re-create all the
  externally masked maps using external masks defined by the new
  auto-masked map. This will be the case if the auto-masked map has
  been changed significantly by the addition of the new
  observation. To do this, it is necessary to compare the old and new
  masks. The old masks should have been created earlier using the
  \param{MASKOUT1} and \param{MASKOUT2} parameters (see Step~3 in
  \cref{Section}{sec:dr}{POL-2 Data Reduction -- The Theory}). To
  create the new masks that would be generated from the new
  auto-masked map, use this command.

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map  in=^infiles iout=! qout=! uout=! mapdir=maps mask=iauto_new \
     maskout1=astmask_new  maskout2=pcamask_new
\end{terminalv}

\item Decide if the addition of the new data has changed the masks
  significantly. This involves comparing \file{astmask.sdf} and
  \file{astmask$\_$new.sdf} (and also \file{pcamask.sdf} and
  \file{pcamask$\_$new.sdf}).


\item If the mask has changed significantly and all observations need
  to be reprocessed using the new mask, or if \task{skyloop} is being used,
  remove the existing externally masked maps so that they will be re-created by
  the next invocation of \task{pol2map}.  Note that this will increase the length of
  time taken by Step~6 enormously.

  Ensure that the new auto-masked co-add is used in place of the old one, in order to
  define any new masks needed in future:

\begin{terminalv}
% rm mapdir/*Qmap.sdf mapdir/*Umap.sdf mapdir/*Imap.sdf
% mv iauto.sdf iauto_old.sdf
% mv iauto_new.sdf iauto.sdf
\end{terminalv}

\item Re-create the necessary externally masked maps and co-adds, and
  then create the new vector catalogue:

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=iext_new qout=! uout=! mapdir=maps \
     mask=iauto
% pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=! qout=qext_new uout=uext_new mapdir=maps \
     mask=iauto ipref=iext_new cat=mycat_new debias=yes
\end{terminalv}
\end{enumerate}


\section{\xlabel{pixelsize}Experimenting with pixel sizes}

Currently,the default map pixel size is 4\si{\arcsecond} at both
850 and \SI{450}{\micro\metre}. The pixel size is controlled by the
\param{PIXSIZE} parameter in the \smurf\ \poltwomap\ command.

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map pixsize=12
\end{terminalv}


The following four-step example shows how to investigate the impact of
changing pixel size.  In this example, 12\si{\arcsecond}
pixels and 7\si{\arcsecond} pixels are compared.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Begin with an auto-masked total-intensity map from the raw
  data. For instance:

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map in=^myfiles.list iout=iauto12 pixsize=12 qout=! uout=! \
     mapdir=maps12 qudir=qudata
\end{terminalv}


\item Create AST and PCA masks with 12\si{\arcsecond} pixels from the
  \file{iauto12.sdf} file.


\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=! qout=! uout=! mapdir=maps12 mask=iauto12 \
     maskout1=astmask12 maskout2=pcamask12
\end{terminalv}

\item Create masks with 7\si{\arcsecond} pixels by resampling the
  12\si{\arcsecond} masks created at Step~2. This is done using the
  \Kappa\ \xref{\task{sqorst}}{sun95}{SQORST} command:

\begin{terminalv}
% sqorst  mode=pixelscale pixscale=\'7,7,7E-05\' in=astmask12 out=astmask7
% sqorst  mode=pixelscale pixscale=\'7,7,7E-05\' in=pcamask12 out=pcamask7
\end{terminalv}

\item Create the 7\si{\arcsecond} externally masked $I$, $Q$, and $U$ maps
  using the above 7\si{\arcsecond} masks (note the \texttt{mask}
  parameter value is enclosed in single \emph{and} double quotes).

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=iext7 qout=qext7 uout=uext7 masktype=mask \
                  mask="'astmask7,pcamask7'" mapdir=maps7 ipref=iext7  \
                  cat=cat7 debias=yes
\end{terminalv}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{tip}
  Using larger pixels usually produces slower convergence, and so the
  above process will take longer than usual---be patient!

  Using larger pixels can sometimes encourage smooth blobs and other
  artificial features to appear in the map. The \file{iauto12.sdf} file
  should be examined to check that it does not have such artificial
  features.

  Check the masks (\file{astmask12.sdf} and \file{pcamask12.sdf}) to make sure they
  look reasonable.

  It is usually advisable to leave \param{PIXSIZE} at its default value
  and instead use the \param{BINSIZE} parameter to control the bin size in
  the vector catalogue---see \cref{Section}{sec:pol2map-pixelsize}{Changing pixel size in pol2map}).
\end{tip}

\section{\xlabel{IPerror}Investigating systematic error in IP}


The error on the IP is reported to be of the order of 0.5\%.  It is
possible to investigate the effects of the systematic error in IP by
creating maps using the upper and lower limits on the IP value. The
\task{makemap} configuration parameter called \xparam{IPOFFSET}{ipoffset}
can be used to conduct such an investigation. To use it, run \poltwomap\ twice,
as follows.

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2map config="ipoffset=-0.25"
% pol2map config="ipoffset=0.25"
\end{terminalv}

This will produce maps using the upper and lower IP limits (a range of
0.5\%). If \task{pol2map} has already been run on POL-2 data, then a file will
already exist that was created using the mean IP (the mean IP is used
if \param{ipoffset} is omitted from the configuration value, or the
configuration parameter itself is omitted).

%\section{\xlabel{simulations}Simulated data}


\section{\label{sec:wcscopy}Adding WCS information back into a vector catalogue}
Vector catalogues produced by \poltwomap\ contain information about World Coordinate
Systems (WCS) in two different forms:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The catalogue contains \catcol{RA} and \catcol{Dec} columns that hold the sky position
(FK5, J2000) of each vector, in radians.
\item The catalogue header contains a Starlink ``WCS FrameSet'' which defines
(amongst other things) the projection from pixel coordinates within
the $I$, $Q$, and $U$ mosaics, to RA and Dec. This FrameSet is used by Starlink software, together
with the pixels coordinates stored in the \catcol{X} and \catcol{Y} columns, to determine
the RA and Dec of each vector. The WCS FrameSet also defines the polarimetric
reference direction used by the \catcol{Q}, \catcol{U}, and \catcol{ANG} values. See
``\xref{Using World Co-ordinate Systems}{sun95}{se_wcsuse}''
within \xref{SUN/95}{sun95}{} (the \KAPPA\ manual) for more information on
the ways in which Starlink software handles WCS information.
\end{enumerate}

Starlink software such as \polpack, \Kappa, and \gaia\ rely on the WCS
FrameSet for all WCS-related operations (drawing annotated axes, aligning
data sets, \emph{etc}). Thus, problems are likely to arise if the WCS FrameSet
is removed from the vector catalogue. This could happen if, for instance,
inappropriate software is used to process an existing catalogue, creating a
new output catalogue. Under such circumstances, the WCS FrameSet might
not be copied to the output catalogue, causing subsequent WCS-related
operations to fail. It is safe to use \POLPACK, \KAPPA, \GAIA, and
\CURSAref, as all these packages copy the WCS
FrameSet to any new output catalogues. Unfortunately, the popular
\topcat\ catalogue browser (see
\url{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/topcat/}) and the STILTS package
(\url{http://www.starlink.ac.uk/stilts/}) upon which it is based, do
\emph{not} copy the WCS FrameSet to any output catalogues.

For this reason, \POLPACK\ contains a command that can be used to copy the
WCS FrameSet from one catalogue to another.  For example: you create
the catalogue \file{mycat.FIT} using \poltwomap, uses \textsc{Topcat}
to remove low signal-to-noise vectors, and then saves the results to a new catalogue
called \file{selcat.FIT}. The WCS FrameSet would then be missing from \file{selcat.FIT},
and so it would be necessary to copy it back into place again from the original catalogue
file, \file{mycat.FIT}. To do this, run the ``\xref{polwcscopy}{sun223}{POLWCSCOPY}''
command.

\begin{terminalv}
% polwcscopy in=selcat ref=mycat out=selcat2
\end{terminalv}

This would create a third catalogue \file{selcat2.FIT}, which would be a copy of
\file{selcat.FIT}, but with the WCS information inherited from \file{mycat.FIT}.


\section{\xlabel{vectorerrorremodelling}Re-modelling the error estimates in a POL-2 vector catalogue}

If the \texttt{MAPVAR=YES} option is used when running the \smurf\ \poltwomap\ script,
the \catcol{I}, \catcol{Q}, and \catcol{U} error estimates in the resulting vector catalogue will be based
on the spread of pixel values at each point on the sky in the $I$,
$Q$, and $U$ maps made from individual observations. Thus, if 20 observations are
processed by \task{pol2map} to create a vector catalogue, then each
\catcol{DI}, \catcol{DQ}, or \catcol{DU} error estimate in the vector catalogue will be based on the spread of 20
independent measurements of $I$, $Q$, or $U$.  Even though 20 observations is a lot of
POL-2 data, 20 is still a fairly small number from which to produce an accurate
estimate of the error. Consequently, it is usual to see a large level of random
``noise'' on the error estimates, as in the following example, which
shows the total-intensity ($I$) error estimates taken from a 12\si{\arcsecond} vector
catalogue near Ophiuchus L\,1688 (\cref{Figure}{fig:originalerrors}{}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.46\linewidth]{sc22-ophl1688-noise_on_error-1.png}
\caption [Original Error Estimates in POL-2 Vector Catalogue for Oph L\,1688]{
  The initial total-intensity ($I$) error estimates taken from a 12\si{\arcsecond} vector
  catalogue near Ophiuchus L\,1688. Note that the noise level increases towards the edge
  of the map due to there being fewer bolometer samples per pixel near the edge.
\label{fig:originalerrors}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty on the error estimate can cause some vectors that are clearly
wrong (e.g. because they are very different from nearby vectors) to have
anomalously low error estimates and so to be included in the set of ``good''
vectors (i.e. vectors that pass some suitable selection criterion based on the
noise estimates).

One simple solution to this could be to apply some spatial smoothing
to the error estimates. This would be a reasonable thing to do if
there were no compact sources in the map. The errors close to a
compact source are generally higher than those in a background region
because of factors such as pointing errors and calibration errors.
These factors cause a compact source to appear slightly different in
each observation, and so cause higher error estimates in the vector
catalogue. The above error estimates map shows this effect in the
higher values at the very centre. Simply smoothing this map would
spread that central feature out, artificially decreasing the peak
error and increasing the errors in the neighbouring background pixels.

An alternative to smoothing is to split the total noise up into
several different components, create a model of each component, and
then add the models together. The \task{pol2noise} script in \smurf\
enables you to re-model the noise estimates in a vector catalogue
using such an approach. This facility is used by setting
\texttt{MODE=REMODEL} on the \task{pol2noise} command line:

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2noise mycat.FIT mode=remodel out=newcat.FIT exptime=iext debiastype=mas
\end{terminalv}

This creates an output catalogue (\file{newcat.FIT}) holding a copy of
the input catalogue (\file{mycat.FIT}), and then calculates new values
for all the error columns in the output catalogue. The new $I$, $Q$,
and $U$ error values are first derived from a three-component model of
the noise in each quantity, and then errors for the derived quantities
(\catcol{PI}, \catcol{P}, and \catcol{ANG}) are found. New values of
\catcol{PI} and \catcol{P} are also found using
the specified de-biasing algorithm. The file \file{iext.sdf} holds the
total-intensity co-add map created by \poltwomap\ and is used to define
the total exposure time in each pixel. The re-modelled total-intensity
error estimates are shown in (\cref{Figure}{fig:newerrors}{}).

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.46\linewidth]{sc22-ophl1688-pol2-noise-remod-1.png}
\caption [Remodelled Error Estimates in POL-2 Vector Catalogue for Oph L\,1688]{

  comparison with \cref{Figure}{fig:originalerrors}{}.
\label{fig:newerrors}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Most of the noise has gone without reducing the resolution. The script
displays the original and re-modelled error estimates for each Stokes
parameter ($I$, $Q$, and $U$), the residuals between the two, and a scatter
plot (\cref{Figure}{fig:remodellingwindow}{}). The best-fitting
straight lines through each scatter plot are also displayed.

($I$, $Q$, and $U$) plots are shown, together with residuals images and associated
straight-line fits.
}
\label{fig:remodellingwindow}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The three components used to model the error on each Stokes parameter($I$, $V$,
or $U$) are described below.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf The background component:} This is derived from an exposure-time
map (obtained from \file{iext.sd}f in the above example). The background
component is equal to $A.tB$, where $t$ is the exposure time at each pixel,
and $A$ and $B$ are constants determined by doing a linear fit between the log
of the noise estimate in the catalogue (\catcol{DQ}, \catcol{DU}, or \catcol{DI}) and the log of the
exposure time (in practice, $B$ is usually close to -0.5). The fit excludes
bright source areas, but also excludes a thin rim around the edge of the map
where the original noise estimates are subject to large inaccuracies. Since
the exposure-time map is usually very much smoother than the original noise
estimates, the background component is also much smoother. \item {\bf The
source component:} This represents the extra noise found in and around compact
sources caused by pointing errors, calibration errors, etc. The background
component is first subtracted from the catalogue noise estimates and the
residual noise values are then modelled using a collection of Gaussians. This
modelling is done using the \texttt{GaussClumps} algorithm provided by the
\task{findclumps} command in the Starlink \cupid\ package. The noise residuals
are first divided into a number of ``islands'', each island being a collection
of contiguous pixels with noise residual significantly higher than zero (this
is done using the \texttt{FellWalker} algorithm in \cupid). The
\texttt{GaussClumps} algorithm is then used to model the noise residuals in
each island. The resulting model is smoothed lightly using a Gaussian kernel
of FWHM 1.2 pixels.

\item {\bf The residual component:} This represents any noise not accounted
for by the other two models. The noise residuals are first found by
subtracting the other two components from the original catalogue noise
estimates. Any strong outlier values are removed and the results are smoothed
more heavily using a Gaussian kernel of FWHM 4 pixels.
\end{enumerate}

The final model is the sum of the above three components. The new
\catcol{DI}, \catcol{DQ}, and
\catcol{DU} values are found independently using the above method. The errors for the
derived quantities (\catcol{DPI}, \catcol{DP}, and \catcol{DANG}) are then found
from \catcol{DQ}, \catcol{DU}, and \catcol{DI} using the usual error-propagation
formulae. Finally new \catcol{P} and \catcol{PI} values are found
using a specified form of de-biasing (controlled by the Parameter
\param{DEBIASTYPE}).


\section{\xlabel{vectoredebiaschanging}Changing the de-biasing in a POL-2 vector catalogue}

The new \poledit\ command in the Starlink \POLPACK\ package has an option
to recalculate the \catcol{PI} (polarised intensity) and \catcol{P} (percentage polarisation)
values using a specified form of de-biasing. If the existing catalogue is in
file \file{mycat.FIT}, this can be done with the following commands.

\begin{terminalv}
% polpack
% poledit mycat newcat mode=debias debiastype=mas
\end{terminalv}

This will create a new file, \file{newcat.FIT}, containing a copy of
\file{mycat.FIT}, but with new \catcol{P} and \catcol{PI} columns re-calculated from the
existing \catcol{Q}, \catcol{U}, \catcol{I}, and \catcol{DPI} values using the ``Modified Asymptotic'' (MAS) bias
estimator (any de-biasing used to create the original catalogue is ignored).
The options for the \param{DEBIASTYPE} parameter are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf MAS:} de-bias using the modified asymptotic estimator;
\item {\bf AS:} de-bias using the asymptotic estimator; and
\item {\bf None:} do not include any de-biasing.
\end{enumerate}

\cref{Figure}{fig:poleditdebias-1}{} shows the results of using the
\task{poledit} command with the various \param{DEBIASTYPE} parameter options
listed above.

  above (red is ``AS'', blue is ``MAS'', and green is ``None'').

\end{figure}


\section{\xlabel{smooth450}Smoothing 450-\SI{}{\textbf{\micro\metre}}
POL-2 maps to 850-\SI{}{\textbf{\micro\metre}}-map resolution}

The \poltwomap\ script has a parameter, \param{SMOOTH450}, to enable you to smooth
\SI{450}{\micro\metre} POL-2 maps to the same resolution as their \SI{850}{\micro\metre}
counterparts. It is only accessed when processing \SI{450}{\micro\metre} data, and defaults
to \texttt{False}, which results in no changes to the behaviour of \poltwomap. If
\param{SMOOTH450} is set to \texttt{True}, \poltwomap\ performs an additional smoothing
that results in the resolution of the resulting
$I$, $Q$, and $U$ co-adds (and the vector catalogue) being degraded to the resolution expected
for \SI{850}{\micro\metre} data. This allows 450 and 850 \SI{}{\micro\metre} results to be
compared more easily. A side-effect of the smoothing is that the noise
levels in the final \SI{450}{\micro\metre} maps and catalogues is lower.

The smoothing is applied to the $I$, $Q$, and $U$ maps made from each
individual observation before using them to form the $I$, $Q$, and $U$ co-adds. The
same smoothing kernel is used for $I$, $Q$, and $U$ and is formed by deconvolving the
expected \SI{850}{\micro\metre} beam shape using the expected
\SI{450}{\micro\metre} beam shape as the PSF (Point Spread Function). The
``expected'' beam shapes are two-component Gaussians as described in
\cite{dempsey12}.

\cref{Figure}{fig:smooth450psf}{} shows the effect of the \param{SMOOTH450} on
the mean radial total-intensity profile of 3C\,279 determined from 25 POL-2
observations. It can be seen that the smoothed \SI{450}{\micro\metre} curve is
very similar to the \SI{850}{\micro\metre} curve.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{sc22-smooth450-psf-1.png}

  \SI{850}{\micro\metre} profile.

\end{figure}

\cref{Figure}{fig:smooth450map}{} shows an example of the effect of the
\param{SMOOTH450} on a vector map for POL-2 observations of the molecular
cloud DR\,21. The main difference is that there are many more red vectors than
blue vectors. This is because the smoothing introduced by \param{SMOOTH450}
has reduced the noise level, thus allowing more vectors to pass the above
selection criterion.

  \param{SMOOTH450} = \texttt{YES}. Both red and blue used the same selection criterion
  (\texttt{I>5*DI \&\& DP <0.5 \&\& DANG < 10}).

\section{\xlabel{controllingpol2mapmasks}Controlling the masks used by pol2map}

As noted earlier, the map-making process used by the \poltwomap\ command uses
two masks, each of which divides the field up into source and background
regions.

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\bf The AST mask:} This is used to define the background regions that are to be 
forced to zero after each iteration of the map-maker algorithm (except the last
iteration). This form of masking helps prevent the growth of artificial large-scale 
structures within the map. Any real astronomical signal present within the masked
background regions will tend to be suppressed in the final map, so it is important
that the AST mask correctly identifies regions of significant emission down to a low level.

\item {\bf The PCA mask:} This is used to define the source regions that are
to be excluded from the Principal Component Analysis. This analysis is used to
remove the correlated backgrounds in the bolometer time-stream data. The
time-stream data for astronomical sources are not correlated across
bolometers, and so tend to disrupt the PCA. For this reason source regions are
excluded from the analysis. \end{enumerate}

Two separate masks are used because experience has shown that disruption of
the PCA is caused mainly by the brighter central source regions. Consequently,
the source regions within the PCA mask can be smaller than the source regions
within the AST mask, as illustrated in \cref{Figure}{fig:mapmasks}{}.

\begin{figure}[ht!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{sc-22-map-masks-1.png}
\caption [Example POL-2 map of DR\,21, showing the difference between the two
  \poltwomap\ masks.]{A total-intensity map of DR\,21, showing the AST mask in green and
  the slightly smaller PCA mask in blue.
\label{fig:mapmasks}
}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Default masks are created automatically by \poltwomap\ in a manner specified by the \param{MASK} parameter.

\begin{enumerate}
\item On `Step~1' of a typical POL-2 data reduction, \param{MASK} is left at its default value of
\texttt{Auto}, causing new masks to be generated automatically at the end of each iteration of 
the map-making algorithm. This ``auto-masking'' process identifies an initial set of sources by 
thresholding the current map estimate at the SNR value specified by Configuration Parameter 
\param{xxx.ZERO\_SNR}, where \texttt{xxx} is either \texttt{AST} or \texttt{PCA}, depending on 
which mask is being generated. Each of these initial source regions is then expanded to include 
adjoining pixels down to the SNR level specified by Configuration Parameter 
\param{xxx.ZERO\_SNRLO}.

\item On `Step~2' and `Step~3' of a typical POL-2 data reduction, \param{MASK}
is set to the co-add of all the total-intensity maps created at Step~1. The
\poltwomap\ script first creates a pair of AST and PCA masks from the supplied
co-added map, and then uses these masks on all iterations of the map-making
algorithm \footnote{For completeness, it should be mentioned that the COM and
FLT models are also masked, in addition to the AST and PCA models. At Step~1
(the auto-masking stage), the masking of COM and FLT is controlled by a
similar set of configuration parameters to those of AST or PCA, except that
\texttt{xxx} becomes \texttt{COM} or \texttt{FLT}.  At Steps~2 and 3 (the
external-masking stages), the COM and FLT models are masked using the PCA mask
generated by \task{findclumps}, and so COM and FLT masking cannot be
controlled independently of the PCA mask.}. The \task{findclumps} command in
the Starlink \CUPID\ package is used by \poltwomap\ to create the masks. The
process used by \task{findclumps} is the same as describe above for
Step~1--initial sources are defined by a fixed SNR threshold within the
supplied co-add and these are then extended down to a lower SNR threshold. The
\poltwomap\ command sets these threshold values to the values of the four
configuration parameters listed above---\param{AST.ZERO\_SNR},
\param{AST.ZERO\_SNRLO}, \param{PCA.ZERO\_SNR}, and \param{PCA.ZERO\_SNRLO}.

\end{enumerate}

These configuration parameter all default to the following values specified in the \poltwomap\ 
script:

\begin{terminalv}
AST.ZERO_SNR = 3 
AST.ZERO_SNRLO = 2 
PCA.ZERO_SNR = 5 
PCA.ZERO_SNRLO = 3
\end{terminalv}

To investigate the effects of changing these values, new values can be supplied, using the
\param{CONFIG} parameter of the \task{pol2map} command \footnote{Note that prior
to 2019 July 10, this method could only be used at Step~1 (the supplied settings were ignored
if supplied at Steps~2 or 3). Later versions of \task{pol2map} do not suffer from this
limitation---the supplied values are honoured at all steps.}.  Here is an
example.

\begin{terminalv}
% more conf
ast.zero_snr = 2.5
ast.zero_snrlo = 1.5
% pol2map config=^conf
\end{terminalv}

Any values not specified will retain their default values listed above.


\section{\xlabel{checkingconvergence}Checking for convergence in pol2map log files}

When processing POL-2 data, it is important to know that the map-making algorithm converged
correctly for all observations. This information is available in the \poltwomap\ log file, along with
the rest of the \makemap\ or \skyloop\ output.  However, the log file can be very long, and
so finding the relevant information may not be straightforward, particularly for users unfamiliar
with the screen output usually created by \task{makemap} or \task{skyloop}.

To help with this, a simple Python script called
\file{pol2logcheck.py}\footnote{This script is available at
\url{https://www.eao.hawaii.edu/~dberry/pol2logcheck.py}.} is available, which
searches a specified \task{pol2map} log file for the relevant information and
reports any observations that did not converge. This can be used as in the
following example.

\begin{terminalv}
% pol2logcheck.py omc1/pol2map.log.3

omc1/pol2map.log.3: 

 Looks like a step 1 log file
  The following observation(s) failed to converge:

\section{\xlabel{combiningfields}Combining multiple POL-2 fields}

To combine POL-2 observations for multiple overlapping fields, the best way to
proceed is probably as follows\footnote{This method requires the use of a
Starlink build from 2019 June 9 or later.}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Run `Step~1' independently for each field. In other words, use \poltwomap\ to create an
auto-masked total-intensity map for each field. The following assumes that \task{pol2map} is run
within directories called \file{field1}, \file{field2}, etc., to create the auto-masked maps
and the $I$, $Q$, and $U$ time-stream data for each field.

\item Co-add the auto-masked total-intensity maps for all fields. First, create a text file holding
the paths to the separate auto-masked total-intensity maps, and then run \task{pol2map} as
follows.

\begin{terminalv}
        % more infiles
        field1/iauto
        field2/iauto
        % pol2map in=^infiles iout=iauto_mosaic \
                  qout=! uout=! multiobject=yes
\end{terminalv}

\item Run `Step~2' and `Step~3' for each field, using the mosaic created above as the mask field 
for all fields. For instance, for the first field:

\begin{terminalv}
        % cd field1
        % pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=iext qout=! \
                  uout=! mapdir=maps mapvar=yes \
                  skyloop=yes mask=../iauto_mosaic 
        % pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=! qout=qext \
                  uout=uext mapdir=maps mapvar=yes \
                  skyloop=yes mask=../iauto_mosaic \
                  ipref=iext cat=mycat debias=yes
\end{terminalv}

\item then, do the same for \file{field2}, \file{field3}, etc. If preferred, Steps~2 and 3 can be 
combined into a single invocation of \task{pol2map}.

\begin{terminalv}
        % cd field1
        % pol2map in=qudata/\* iout=iext qout=qext \
                  uout=uext mapdir=maps mapvar=yes \
                  skyloop=yes mask=../iauto_mosaic \
                  ipref=iext cat=mycat debias=yes
\end{terminalv}

\item Co-add the external-masked $I$, $Q$, and $U$ maps for all fields and create a vector
catalogue from  the co-added maps. First, create a text file holding the paths to the
external-masked  $I$, $Q$, and $U$ maps  for all fields, and then run \task{pol2map}
as follows.

 \begin{terminalv}
        % more infiles
        field1/iext
        field1/qext
        field1/uext
        field2/iext
        field2/qext
        field2/uext
        % pol2map in=^infiles iout=iext_mosaic \
                  qout=qext_mosaic uout=uext_mosaic \
                  multiobject=yes cat=mycat_mosaic \
                  debias=yes ipcor=no
\end{terminalv}

\end{enumerate}
